# Remodex / CodexLink upstream base

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/remodex)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remodex)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache--2.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)
[Follow on X](https://x.com/emanueledpt)

Control [Codex](https://openai.com/index/codex/) from your iPhone. Remodex is a local-first open-source bridge + iOS app that keeps the Codex runtime on your Mac and lets your phone connect through a paired secure session.

## Key App Features

- End-to-end encrypted pairing and chats between your iPhone and Mac
- Fast mode for lower-latency turns
- Plan mode for structured planning before execution
- Subagents from iPhone with the `/subagents` command
- Steer active runs without starting over
- Queue follow-up prompts while a turn is still running
- In-app notifications when turns finish or need attention
- Git actions from your phone, including commit, push, pull, and branch switching
- Reasoning controls to tune how much thinking Codex uses
- Access controls with On-Request or Full access
- Photo attachments from camera or library
- One-time QR bootstrap with trusted Mac reconnects
- macOS-only background bridge service via `launchd`
- Live streaming on your phone while Codex runs on your Mac
- Shared thread history with Codex on your Mac

The repo stays local-first and self-host friendly: the iOS app source does not embed a public hosted endpoint, and the transport layer remains inspectable for anyone who wants to run their own setup.

Today, the background daemon / trusted auto-reconnect flow is implemented for macOS. Self-hosted relay setups still work on other OSes, but they currently use the foreground bridge flow instead of the macOS `launchd` service path.

If you want the public-repo distribution model explained clearly, read [SELF_HOSTING_MODEL.md](SELF_HOSTING_MODEL.md).

## Get the App

The app is live on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/remodex-remote-ai-coding/id6760243963).

Build the iOS app from source in Xcode, install your own signed build on-device, then use the in-app onboarding flow to pair by scanning the QR from `remodex up`.

If you scan the pairing QR with a generic camera or QR reader before installing the app, your device may treat the QR payload as plain text and open a web search instead of pairing.

```

1. Run `remodex up` on your Mac
2. On macOS, Remodex installs/starts a lightweight background bridge service and prints a QR for first-time pairing or recovery
3. Scan the QR once with the Remodex iOS app to trust that Mac
4. After the first handshake, the iPhone can resolve the Mac's live session through the configured relay and reconnect automatically
5. Your phone sends instructions to Codex through the bridge and receives responses in real-time
6. The bridge handles git operations and local session persistence on your Mac
7. When the local Codex IPC bus is available, Remodex broadcasts live conversation state to Codex Desktop / VSCode; persisted JSONL history and the optional refresh workaround remain as fallbacks

```

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18+
- **[Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex)** installed and in your PATH
- **Codex CLI authenticated on the Mac** (`codex login status` should succeed)
- **[Codex desktop app](https://openai.com/index/codex/)** (optional — for viewing threads on your Mac)
- **A signed Remodex iOS build** installed on your iPhone or iPad before scanning the pairing QR
- **macOS** (for desktop refresh features — the core bridge works on any OS)
- **Xcode 16+** (only if building the iOS app from source)

## Codex Authentication

Remodex does not manage OpenAI credentials. It expects the local Codex CLI to be installed and authenticated before the bridge starts:

```sh
codex login status
codex login
```

If startup fails with `Missing environment variable: CODEX_API_KEY`, that error is coming from your Codex CLI configuration, not from Remodex. The safest recovery is to authenticate Codex directly, then restart Remodex:

```sh
codex login
remodex restart
```

If you intentionally use API-key auth, configure Codex itself rather than storing keys in Remodex:

```sh
printenv OPENAI_API_KEY | codex login --with-api-key
remodex restart
```

Do not put live OpenAI API keys into the Remodex launchd plist or relay configuration.

## Install the Bridge

<sub>Install from npm with `@latest` so you get the newest bridge fixes.</sub>

If you plan to use the macOS menu bar companion, `remodex` must be installed globally and available in your login-shell `PATH`.

```sh
npm install -g remodex@latest
```

To update an existing global install later:

```sh
npm install -g remodex@latest
```

If the macOS background service is installed, run `remodex restart` after updating. It refreshes the saved Node/CLI paths and LaunchAgent policy used by `launchd` without replacing your pairing state.

If you only want to try Remodex, you can install it from npm and run it without cloning this repository.

## Quick Start

Install the bridge, then run:

```sh
remodex up
```

On first connect, open the Remodex app, follow the onboarding flow, then scan the QR code from inside the app.

After that first scan:

- the iPhone saves the Mac as a trusted device
- the Mac bridge keeps its identity locally
- the app tries trusted reconnect automatically on later launches
- the QR remains available as a recovery path if trust changes or the relay cannot resolve the live session

For now, the daemon-backed trusted reconnect path is macOS-only. If you self-host on Linux or Windows, pairing still works, but the bridge runs in the foreground unless you set up your own OS-specific service wrapper.

## Run Locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Emanuele-web04/remodex.git
cd remodex
./run-local-remodex.sh
```

That launcher starts a local relay, points the bridge at `ws://<your-host>:9000/relay` by default, and prints the pairing QR for the iPhone app.

For iPhone self-hosting, the recommended path is Tailscale or another stable private network. Plain LAN pairing over `ws://<lan-ip>` on the same Wi-Fi is still available for local testing, but it can be unreliable on some iOS devices even when the relay and Wi-Fi are healthy.

Options:

- `./run-local-remodex.sh --hostname <lan-hostname-or-ip>`
- `./run-local-remodex.sh --relay-url https://<random>.trycloudflare.com`
- `./run-local-remodex.sh --bind-host 127.0.0.1 --port 9100`

If your iPhone is pairing over LAN, use a hostname or IP the phone can actually reach.

For a temporary Cloudflare Tunnel, run this in one terminal:

```sh
cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:9000
```

Then pass the generated `https://<random>.trycloudflare.com` URL to the local launcher in another terminal:

```sh
./run-local-remodex.sh --relay-url https://<random>.trycloudflare.com
```

The launcher advertises that as `wss://<random>.trycloudflare.com/relay` in the pairing QR while keeping the relay process local.

## Custom Relay Endpoint

For a full public self-hosting walkthrough, see [`Docs/self-hosting.md`](Docs/self-hosting.md).

If you want the npm bridge to point at your own setup instead of the package default, override `REMODEX_RELAY` explicitly:

```sh
REMODEX_RELAY="ws://localhost:9000/relay" remodex up
```

For self-hosted iPhone usage, prefer a relay URL reachable over Tailscale or another stable private network. Treat plain local `ws://192.168.x.x` pairing as best-effort rather than the recommended production path on iOS.

A common private setup looks like this:

1. Run the relay on your Mac, a mini server, or a VPS you control
2. Put that machine on Tailscale
3. Set `REMODEX_RELAY` to the Tailscale-reachable `ws://` or `wss://` relay URL
4. Pair once with QR
5. Let the iPhone reconnect to the same trusted Mac over that relay later

If that relay is fronting a Mac bridge, the macOS daemon can keep the bridge alive for hands-free reconnects. If you self-host against a non-macOS bridge, the same relay path still works, but automatic background service management is not built in yet.

Reverse-proxy subpaths work too, so a hosted relay behind Traefik can live under the same domain as other APIs:

```sh
REMODEX_RELAY="wss://api.example.com/remodex/relay" remodex up
```

In that setup, the public endpoints can look like this:

- `wss://api.example.com/remodex/relay`
- `https://api.example.com/remodex/v1/push/session/register-device`
- `https://api.example.com/remodex/v1/push/session/notify-completion`

Have the proxy strip `/remodex` before forwarding so the relay still receives `/relay/...` and `/v1/push/...`.

If you point `REMODEX_RELAY` at your own self-hosted relay, managed push stays off unless you also set `REMODEX_PUSH_SERVICE_URL` on the bridge and explicitly enable push on the relay.

## Commands

### `remodex up`

Starts Remodex.

On macOS, `remodex up` is the friendly entrypoint for the background bridge service:

- Writes the daemon config used by the `launchd` service
- Starts or restarts the background bridge service
- Waits for a pairing payload and prints a QR for first-time trust or recovery
- Keeps the bridge alive even if you close the terminal later

On non-macOS platforms, `remodex up` runs the bridge in the foreground.

In both cases the bridge:

- Spawns `codex app-server` (or connects to an existing endpoint)
- Connects the Mac bridge to the configured relay
- Forwards JSON-RPC messages bidirectionally
- Handles git commands from the phone
- Persists the active thread for later resumption

### `remodex start`

macOS only. Starts the background bridge service without waiting for or printing a QR in the current terminal.
If the service is already loaded, this path refreshes it in place.

### `remodex restart`

macOS only. Explicitly restarts the background bridge service without waiting for or printing a QR in the current terminal.
If a service is already installed, restart regenerates its LaunchAgent plist with the current Node/CLI paths and re-bootstraps it, so run it after updating the package. It does not rewrite the saved relay configuration.

### `remodex stop`

macOS only. Stops the background bridge service and clears its transient runtime status.

### `remodex uninstall-service`

macOS only. Unloads the background bridge service from `launchd` and removes its LaunchAgent plist. Saved configuration, logs, and trusted-device data in `~/.remodex` are preserved for a future reinstall.

To remove Remodex completely and safely:

```sh
remodex uninstall-service
npm uninstall -g remodex
```

### `remodex status`

macOS only. Prints the current `launchd` / bridge status, including whether the service is loaded and whether a recent pairing payload exists.

### `remodex run-service`

macOS only. Internal service entrypoint used by `launchd`. You normally do not run this manually.

### `remodex --version`

Prints the installed Remodex CLI version.

```sh
remodex --version
# => 2.0.0
```

### `remodex reset-pairing`

Clears the saved bridge pairing state so the next trusted connection requires a fresh QR bootstrap again.
You normally do not need this for corrupted local state anymore: recent Remodex builds auto-repair unreadable pairing files/mirrors on startup.

```sh
remodex reset-pairing
# => [remodex] Cleared the saved pairing state. Run `remodex up` to pair again.
```

### `remodex resume`

Reopens the last active thread in Codex.app on your Mac.

```sh
remodex resume
# => [remodex] Opened last active thread: abc-123 (phone)
```

### `remodex watch [threadId]`

Tails the event log for a thread in real-time.

```sh
remodex watch
# => [14:32:01] Phone: "Fix the login bug in auth.ts"
# => [14:32:05] Codex: "I'll look at auth.ts and fix the login..."
# => [14:32:18] Task started
# => [14:33:42] Task complete
```

## Environment Variables

`REMODEX_RELAY` is optional, but the default depends on how you got Remodex:

- public GitHub/source checkouts stay open-source and self-host friendly, so they do not ship with a hosted relay baked in
- official published packages may include a default relay at publish time
- if you are running from source, assume you should use `./run-local-remodex.sh` or set `REMODEX_RELAY` yourself

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `REMODEX_RELAY` | empty in source checkouts; optional in published packages | Session base URL used for QR bootstrap, trusted-session resolve, and phone/Mac session routing |
| `REMODEX_PUSH_SERVICE_URL` | disabled by default | Optional HTTP base URL for managed push registration/completion |
| `REMODEX_CODEX_ENDPOINT` | — | Connect to an existing Codex WebSocket instead of spawning a local `codex app-server` |
| `REMODEX_DESKTOP_IPC_LIVE_SYNC` | `true` | Broadcast Remodex-owned active threads over the local Codex Desktop / VSCode IPC bus |
| `REMODEX_DESKTOP_AUTO_FOLLOW` | `true` on macOS with local IPC | Open a newly materialized phone-driven thread once so Codex Desktop follows its live IPC stream |
| `REMODEX_DESKTOP_IPC_SOCKET` | auto-detected | Override the local Codex IPC socket or Windows named pipe path |
| `REMODEX_DESKTOP_IPC_SNAPSHOT_DEBOUNCE_MS` | `75` | Debounce window (ms) for IPC `conversationState` snapshot / patch broadcasts |
| `REMODEX_REFRESH_ENABLED` | `false` | Auto-refresh Codex.app when phone activity is detected (`true` enables it explicitly) |
| `REMODEX_REFRESH_DEBOUNCE_MS` | `1200` | Debounce window (ms) for coalescing refresh events |
| `REMODEX_REFRESH_COMMAND` | — | Custom shell command to run instead of the built-in AppleScript refresh |
| `REMODEX_CODEX_BUNDLE_ID` | `com.openai.codex` | macOS bundle ID of the Codex app |
| `CODEX_HOME` | `~/.codex` | Codex data directory (used here for `sessions/` rollout files) |

```sh
# Enable desktop refresh explicitly
REMODEX_REFRESH_ENABLED=true remodex up

# Disable local Desktop / VSCode IPC live sync
REMODEX_DESKTOP_IPC_LIVE_SYNC=false remodex up

# Keep phone-driven threads in the sidebar without automatically opening them
REMODEX_DESKTOP_AUTO_FOLLOW=false remodex up

# Connect to an existing Codex instance
REMODEX_CODEX_ENDPOINT=ws://localhost:8080 remodex up

# Use a custom self-hosted relay endpoint (`ws://` is unencrypted)
REMODEX_RELAY="ws://localhost:9000/relay" remodex up

# Enable managed push only if your self-hosted relay also exposes a configured APNs push service
REMODEX_RELAY="wss://relay.example/relay" \
REMODEX_PUSH_SERVICE_URL="https://relay.example" \
remodex up
```

On the relay/VPS side, keep push disabled until you actually want it. The HTTP push endpoints are off by default and only turn on when you set `REMODEX_ENABLE_PUSH_SERVICE=true`.

## Pairing and Safety

- Remodex is local-first: Codex, git operations, and workspace actions run on your Mac, while the iPhone acts as a paired remote control.
- On iPhone, the most reliable self-host setup is a Tailscale-reachable relay. Plain LAN pairing over `ws://` on the same Wi-Fi can fail on some iOS devices because local-network routing from the app is not always reliable.
- The pairing QR carries the connection URL, the session ID, and the bridge identity key used to bootstrap end-to-end encryption. After a successful first scan, the iPhone stores a trusted Mac record in Keychain and the bridge persists its trusted phone identity locally on the Mac.
- On macOS, the bridge can keep running as a lightweight `launchd` service, so the phone can resolve the Mac's current live relay session and reconnect without scanning a new QR every time.
- The QR is still the recovery path when trust changes, the bridge identity rotates, or the relay cannot resolve the current live session.
- The bridge state lives canonically in `~/.remodex/device-state.json` with local-only permissions. On macOS the bridge also mirrors that state to Keychain as best-effort backup/migration data, and recent builds auto-repair unreadable local state on startup instead of requiring manual cleanup.
- The CLI no longer prints the connection URL in plain text below the QR.
- Set `REMODEX_RELAY` only when you want to self-host or test locally against your own setup.
- Leave `REMODEX_TRUST_PROXY` unset for direct/self-hosted installs. Turn it on only when a trusted reverse proxy such as Traefik, Nginx, or Caddy is forwarding the relay traffic.
- The transport implementation is public in [`relay/`](relay/), but your real deployed hostname and credentials should stay private.
- On the iPhone, the default agent permission mode is `On-Request`. Switching the app to `Full access` auto-approves runtime approval prompts from the agent.

## Security and Privacy

Remodex now uses an authenticated end-to-end encrypted channel between the paired iPhone and the bridge running on your Mac. The transport layer still carries the WebSocket traffic, but it does not get the plaintext contents of prompts, tool calls, Codex responses, git output, or workspace RPC payloads once the secure session is established.

The secure channel is built in these steps:

1. The bridge generates and persists a long-term device identity keypair on the Mac.
2. The pairing QR shares the connection URL, session ID, bridge device ID, bridge identity public key, and a short expiry window.
3. During pairing, the iPhone and bridge exchange fresh X25519 ephemeral keys and nonces.
4. The bridge signs the handshake transcript with its Ed25519 identity key, and the iPhone verifies that signature against the public key from the QR code or the previously trusted Mac record.
5. The iPhone signs a client-auth transcript with its own Ed25519 identity key, and the bridge verifies that before accepting the session.
6. Both sides derive directional AES-256-GCM keys with HKDF-SHA256 and then wrap application messages in encrypted envelopes with monotonic counters for replay protection.

Privacy notes:

- The transport layer can still see connection metadata and the plaintext secure control messages used to set up the encrypted session, including session IDs, device IDs, public keys, nonces, and handshake result codes.
- The transport layer does not see decrypted application payloads after the secure handshake succeeds.
- A fresh QR scan can replace the previously trusted iPhone automatically. Use `remodex reset-pairing` only when you intentionally want to wipe the remembered pairing state yourself.
- On-device message history is also encrypted at rest on iPhone using a Keychain-backed AES key.

## SSH Terminal

Remodex can open a native SSH terminal session from your iPhone to a Mac or Windows PC, without going through the bridge. The connection runs directly from the phone over SSH.

Private key material and the optional passphrase are stored in the iOS Keychain with `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly`. This means they are protected by iOS Keychain data protection, accessible only while the device is unlocked, never included in iCloud or iTunes backups, and never migrated to another device. If you switch phones you need to re-import the key.

The in-app setup guide walks you through enabling SSH on the target machine (Remote Login on macOS, OpenSSH Server on Windows), creating a dedicated key pair, and entering the connection details. A ready-made Codex prompt is available in the guide so the AI can walk you through the full setup interactively.

## Git Integration

The bridge intercepts `git/*` JSON-RPC calls from the phone and executes them locally:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `git/status` | Branch, tracking info, dirty state, file list, and diff |
| `git/commit` | Commit staged changes with an optional message |
| `git/push` | Push to remote |
| `git/pull` | Pull from remote (auto-aborts on conflict) |
| `git/branches` | List all branches with current/default markers |
| `git/checkout` | Switch branches |
| `git/createBranch` | Create and switch to a new branch |
| `git/log` | Recent commit history |
| `git/stash` | Stash working changes |
| `git/stashPop` | Pop the latest stash |
| `git/resetToRemote` | Hard reset to remote (requires confirmation) |
| `git/remoteUrl` | Get the remote URL and owner/repo |

## Workspace Integration

The bridge also handles local workspace-scoped revert operations for the assistant revert flow:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `workspace/revertPatchPreview` | Checks whether a reverse patch can be applied cleanly in the local repo |
| `workspace/revertPatchApply` | Applies the reverse patch locally when the preview succeeds |

## Codex Desktop App Integration

Remodex works with both the Codex CLI and the Codex desktop app (`Codex.app`). Under the hood, the bridge spawns a `codex app-server` process — the same JSON-RPC interface that powers the desktop app and IDE extensions. Conversations are persisted as JSONL rollout files under `~/.codex/sessions`, so threads started from your phone show up in the desktop app too.

What is live today:

- The iPhone conversation is live while the bridge session is connected.
- The Mac-side Codex runtime is the real runtime doing the work.
- Desktop-owned threads mirror live to the phone: when you open a thread that Codex Desktop is running, the bridge follows Desktop's IPC `conversationState` stream and projects the timeline, approvals, archive state, title, status, and token usage to the phone.
- Remodex-owned active threads are broadcast over the local Codex IPC bus as Desktop / VSCode-compatible `conversationState` updates, and the bridge answers `thread-follower-*` requests (continue, steer, interrupt, approvals, user input) from any IPC client that chooses to follow them.
- On macOS, a newly created phone thread waits for its rollout to materialize, then Remodex opens that exact Codex route once. Codex responds with `thread-stream-following-changed`; Remodex uses that handshake to deliver an immediate full baseline and keep later patches live.

Current boundaries:

- Codex Desktop only accepts an external stream after that thread's route is mounted. Remodex therefore auto-opens a new phone-driven thread while Codex is already running; it does not cold-launch the desktop app. If Codex is closed or auto-follow is disabled, the thread still reaches the shared session catalog and becomes live when you open it.
- Remodex joins the local IPC bus when Codex Desktop or VSCode has created it. If no local IPC router is running, Remodex starts a compatible local router.
- IPC sync keeps a short debounce and falls back to a full snapshot when a patch would be too large or when a client reconnect requires a fresh baseline.
- The IPC protocol is private to Codex clients, so future Codex Desktop / VSCode changes may require bridge updates.

Remodex also keeps the hand-off button in the iPhone app. It explicitly opens the matching thread in `Codex.app` when you want to switch devices or force Desktop to mount a thread.

The older repeated deep-link refresh workaround remains available, but it is off by default. It is separate from the default one-time auto-follow activation.

```sh
# Enable the old deep-link refresh workaround manually
REMODEX_REFRESH_ENABLED=true remodex up
```

This enables debounced remounts of `codex://threads/<id>` during rollout growth and completion. If the local desktop path is unavailable, the bridge self-disables desktop refresh for the rest of that run instead of retrying noisily forever.

## Connection Resilience

- **Auto-reconnect**: If the session connection drops, the bridge reconnects with exponential backoff (1 s → 5 s max)
- **Secure catch-up**: The bridge keeps a bounded local outbound buffer and re-sends missed encrypted messages after a secure reconnect
- **Codex persistence**: The Codex process stays alive across transient session reconnects during the current bridge run
- **Graceful shutdown**: SIGINT/SIGTERM cleanly close all connections

## Building the iOS App

```sh
cd CodexMobile
open CodexMobile.xcodeproj
```

Build and run on a physical device or simulator with Xcode. The app uses SwiftUI and the current project target is iOS 18.6.

## FAQ

**Do I need an OpenAI API key?**
Not for Remodex itself. You need Codex CLI set up and working independently.

**Does this work on Linux/Windows?**
The core bridge client (Codex forwarding + git) works on any OS. Desktop refresh (AppleScript) is macOS-only, and the built-in daemon / trusted auto-reconnect service path is currently macOS-only too.

**What happens if I close the terminal?**
On macOS, the bridge can keep running in the background through `launchd`, so closing the terminal does not stop the trusted reconnect path. On other OSes, the foreground bridge stops when the terminal stops.

**How do I force a fresh QR pairing?**
Run `remodex reset-pairing`, then start the bridge again with `remodex up`. You should only need this when you intentionally want to replace the paired iPhone or wipe the remembered pairing.

**Can I connect to a remote Codex instance?**
Yes — set `REMODEX_CODEX_ENDPOINT=ws://host:port` to skip spawning a local `codex app-server`.

**Why don't my phone threads show up in the Codex desktop app immediately?**
With `REMODEX_DESKTOP_IPC_LIVE_SYNC=true` and `REMODEX_DESKTOP_AUTO_FOLLOW=true`, Remodex waits for the new rollout, opens its exact route in an already-running Codex app, and confirms the follow handshake before relying on IPC patches. If Codex is closed, the thread remains available through the shared session catalog and is followed when you open it.

**Does Remodex support true live sync between phone and `Codex.app`?**
Yes while the relevant client is following the thread. Desktop-to-phone streams directly over the local IPC bus. Phone-to-Desktop uses a one-time route activation because Codex intentionally ignores external snapshots for unmounted threads; after Codex confirms `following: true`, the timeline and subsequent patches remain live. Disk persistence is still the fallback while Codex is closed.

**Can I self-host the relay?**
Yes. That is the intended forking path. The transport and push-service code are in [`relay/`](relay/); point `REMODEX_RELAY` at the instance you run.

**Can I use Tailscale?**
Yes. It is the recommended private-network option for self-hosting on iPhone. Run your relay somewhere reachable over Tailscale, set `REMODEX_RELAY` to that relay URL, pair once with QR, then let the app reconnect to the trusted Mac through the same relay.

**Is the transport layer safe for sensitive work?**
It is much stronger than a plain text proxy: traffic can be protected in transit with TLS, application payloads are end-to-end encrypted after the secure handshake, and all Codex execution still happens on your Mac. The transport can still observe connection metadata and handshake control messages, so the tightest trust model is to run it yourself.
